# What's the "theory" of music?

I have to say, western culture made music harder as it should be.

The origin of sound is the existence of different frequencies.

We have decorated it too much.

Is there a more intuitive, simpler and better substitution for this music theory?

## I'm disgusting

I hate myself. I'm so disgusting.

I love this loathful me.

I want to write, I want to sing, I want to tell, I want to be seen, I hate such silence.
