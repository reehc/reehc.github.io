> A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. – John Gruber

## Paragraphs
Newlines are treated as spaces.
Two+ spaces at the end of a line is treated as a hard line break.
A backslash followed by a newline is also a hard line break.

## Headers
A blank line before a header.

## Verbatim (code) blocks
