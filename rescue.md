underconstruction.

> This is an article which reflects wonders and sorrows I've experienced, and in which I'll illustrate a possible method for me to live in the rest of my life. 

## Premises

I am lacking of social abilities. I resist almost everyone around me, and I think most of them are kind of strange and much different from me. Clearly, I was not gregarious, and for the sake of my own life, I should think about the way I should take. Hopefully, I won't regard my withered life as meaningless waste.

## Condition

The situation I'm in is not very well, and most of the bad part is created by myself. I'm in a pretty steady and safe situation indeed, but I have a disable mind, then things are much worse. There are some worst things I think I'm taking very hard. 

The first is loneliness. Due to my strange characteristic, I havn't met someone who can really talk and live with me. I do think I am nice but just very cold and sad. I am a little autistic and this is even not the most fatal reason. The really fatal reason is that I don't like people who I've met at all. I don't want to sustain connections with them or expose more my interns to them. All of this led to loneliness. Yes, I have no friends and no listeners. I've been searching for consolation on multiple social networks, especially on anonymous platform.

The second is an icy family. I do feel sad about this, but just only sad.

The third is unreasonable state. This can really kill me, I can't breathe every time I think of it.
