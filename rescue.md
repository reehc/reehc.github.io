> This is an article which reflects wonders and sorrows I've experienced, and in which I'll illustrate a possible method for me to live in the rest of my life. 

## Premises

I am lacking of social abilities. I resist almost everyone around me, and I think most of them are kind of strange and much different from me. Clearly, I was not gregarious, and for the sake of my own life, I should think about the way I should take. Hopefully, I won't regard my withered life as meaningless waste.

## Condition

The situation I'm in is not very well, and most of the bad part is created by myself. I'm in a pretty steady and safe situation indeed, but I have a disable mind, then things are much worse. There are some worst things I think I'm taking very hard. 

The first is loneliness. Due to my strange characteristic, I havn't met someone who can really talk and live with me. I do think I am nice but just very cold and sad. I am a little autistic and this is even not the most fatal reason. The really fatal reason is that I don't like people who I've met at all. I don't want to sustain connections with them or expose more my interns to them. All of this led to loneliness. Yes, I have no friends and no listeners. I've been searching for consolation on multiple social networks, especially on anonymous platform.

The second is an icy family. I do feel sad about this, but just only sad.

The third is unreasonable state. This can really kill me, I can't breathe every time I think of it.

## Rescue

There is a saying, difficulties in life can be quiet different when you change your view. I don't know if this is a better way of observing life.

## Meaning

Life is about learning and creating, or you're just wasting. We sometimes used to waste and cannnot get out, and that time is when we forgot what we really need to do. Do I have to live like this? Yes, I have to. I have to learn and create, or I'm nothing. And for this time, my purposes can be clear. I should concentrate in my major and things I'd like to create. 

My major can be various, but mostly about computer. I can do a lot including vision, intelligence, security, etc. Every area should not be a bad choice. 

I'd really like to write songs, though I don't have enough skills now. Another thing is language, which is essetial for my furture life. Oh, philosophy! Wanna A Complete Me.

## End

Anyway, I decide to live.

I'm gonna prepare for TOEFL & N1.

I'm gonna learn all beautiful and powerful knowledges.

I'm gonna read, understand, and think about the world.

Be yourself.
