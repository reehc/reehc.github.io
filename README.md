# Thoughts

I thought I was going to learn everything, but it's not true. I'm older now but I become quieter than before, so it's not as hard as before for me to live like what I am originally. In short, I'm just showing some related areas about my past and my life, also, learning English and Japanese please. 

## A new Trap?
*Smarter me, small achievement !*
1. **Github Website** . I should write a script which can generate static sites for me, then things will be easier. All I need to do is writing my markdown with meta-infomation and processes after this is automatic.
    - Done. See my *deploy.rb*~
2. **Play With CSS(Cascading Style Sheets)**. Try with pandoc, make this site clean.

## Way out

- read. Emm... I haven't started before Feb 7th. And my spring rest was wasted, How ?
- write. I feel that I have to push it later. And later ?
- Of course I mean books, words and minds.
